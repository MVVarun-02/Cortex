# Cortex
A Secure Document-based Q&amp;A System

## 🚀 Project Overview
Cortex is a secure Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built using LangChain, OpenSearch and HuggingFace embeddings.
It enables multi-document semantic search, private data handling and intelligent question suggestions. Prioritized reliability, scalability and usability.
For me, Cortex isn’t just a side project – it’s about showing how AI can be built responsibly, with security and clarity at its core.

## 🔑 Key Features

 🔒 Data stays private – only your uploaded files are used.
 
 📂 You choose which documents to include in retrieval, giving full control over context.
 
 📚 Cortex handles multiple documents for richer context and better answers.
 
 📝 Accurate answers, grounded solely in the source document.
 
 💡 Smart follow-up question suggestions to guide deeper exploration.
